Algorithm Overview
1. First Initialize The Probabilities
When Placing Pieces, set the probability that that cell has a piece to 1.
Set the probability of it containing any other type of piece or pit to 0
For the rest of the board, set P(W), P(H), and P(M) to 0, and set P(P) to (d/3-1)/d where d is the length of the board
We have to update the board structure to have cells that contain the probability for each of the pieces and the pit
UI also needs to be updated to include probabilities on display during FOW display
2. First update probabilities after opponent moves
Set c = # of remaining opponent pieces
After the opponent moves, for each type of unit, update the probabilities of the unit being there
Might have to have two board structures, if updating probabilities on one board, will lead to incorrect calculations
For each cell in old_board
    cell.prob_wumpus = (1-1/c) * cell.prob_wumpus
    for each neighbor of cell (use x+1, x-1 or whatever to get the neighbors)
        sum += neighbor_cell.prob_wumpus * 1/(c * # of neighbors)
    cell.prob_wumpus += sum
Repeat this process for each type of piece, pits are not updated
3. Then run the observe function on each of for the cells of each of your pieces
For each cell containing our units
    If cell has no stench, then for each adjacent cell
        cell.prob_wumpus = 0
    If cell does receive stench,
        For each of the adjacent cells to the current one,
            Sum the probability of wumpus being in that cell
            Store this as sum
        Then for each adjacent cell
            Set cell.prob_wumpus = cell.prob_wumpus/sum
        For each non-adjacent cells
            cell.prob_wumpus = cell.prob_wumpus * (# of wumpi - 1/ # of wumpi)
Repeat for each types of unit
Might still have to have two copies of board, one old, one new. Not sure tho
4. After we move, for the piece that was moved, we run the observe function
Basically do step 3 but for just that cell for the piece that was moved.

1. Normalize the Probability
Do this after each of the four steps above
    Sum = None
    for each cell in board
        Sum+= cell.prob_wumpus
    alpha = 1/sum
    Let w be the number of Wumpi
    for each cell in board
        cell.prob_wumpus = alpha * cell.prob_wumpus * w
2. After performing the observe function for a cell
    If it has a stench
        Place all adjacent cells with non-zero probabilities into a list for the unit generating the observation
        Do this for each type of unit
        sum = Have to find probabilities for all configurations
            For each entry in each list
                sum += alpha_W*cell1.prob_wumpus*w * alpha_M*cell2.prob_mage*m
        For each entry in each list
            cell.prob_wumpus = cell.prob_wumpus * sum
        Do for all lists and types of units
